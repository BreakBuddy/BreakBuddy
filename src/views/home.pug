    h2 API DOCS
    p BreakBuddy's backend is running on Node.js. We use three endpoints at the moment.
    ul
        li GET /, this returns the page that you are on right now :)
        li POST /game, this endpoint accepts a JSON body and responds with a corresponding country.
        li GET /game/:country, this endpoint returns a PNG image with the given country name.
